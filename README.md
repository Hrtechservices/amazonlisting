The Sure Shot Way to Fix Your Suppressed Amazon Listings
How do Suppressed Listings on Amazon Impact Sellers?

There can be a significant impact of a Suppressed Amazon Listing on the sales of the business. The sales of suppressed listings will be zero. Even if your amazon listing is excellent, it may be suppressed due to unintentional prohibited claims. Amazon’s prohibited claim standards aim to provide customers with accurate information. But sometimes, the Amazon algorithm flags particular claims or keywords. Amazon seller support notifies sellers of incorrectly flagged suppressed listings in two ways:

Stranded Inventory
When an amazon listing is labeled stranded inventory, the ASIN will be cut out from Amazon. It appears as “Stranded Inventory” under “Manage Inventory” on the tab. In the detailed report, Amazon displays more information and instructions about stranded inventory. The common reasons for stranded inventory include missing attributes or flagged prohibited claims. Sellers have two options: appeal or make the necessary corrections. Modifying the copy in the listing can rectify the issue. For instance, removing words like bugs, pests, mildew, mold, and insects from a pesticide claim is suggested. It causes the ASIN to be no longer listed as stranded inventory.

Performance Notifications
Amazon sends performance notifications to sellers when an ASIN is flagged due to a performance issue. Sometimes, Amazon removes the product detail page or sends a message to sellers about the errors. To rectify performance notifications, sellers must submit a Plan of Action(POA). POA should include root causes, corrective actions, and preventive actions. 

Sellers can take the help of Amazon seller support to inspect the flagged ASIN. After submitting a good POA, the performance notification is then eliminated. Sellers can visit the Voice of the Consumer dashboard. It allows them to learn from previous customer complaints about Amazon’s performance.
